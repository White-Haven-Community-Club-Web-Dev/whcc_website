        <p>
          WHCFC aims to be Scarboroughâ€™s first club offering free soccer opportunities, promoting community, diversity, and inclusivity. 
          We strive to foster a welcoming environment for equity-deserving groups and celebrate cultural differences. 
          Our goal is to enhance community spirit through football while providing free educational workshops on essential life skills like project management and mental health.

        <p>
          While some costs may apply for team play and tournaments, we are committed to minimizing these expenses. 
          WHCFC seeks to support marginalized communities by securing funding from government and businesses, 
          ensuring accessibility and minimal costs for participation.
