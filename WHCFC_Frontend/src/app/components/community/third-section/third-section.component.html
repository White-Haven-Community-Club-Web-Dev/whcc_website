      WHCFC believes in the transformative power of sports, and our vision and
      focus are to increase football participation while eliminating barriers to
      this, to give Canadians access to and stay involved in football in
      communities; this aligns to the Canadian Government initiatives to pursue
      healthy lifestyles, because it believes that sport plays an important role
      helping Canadians build the skills they need to grow and thrive
      physically, mentally and socially. Community members that align to these
      values will help WHCFC meet its goals and promote FIFA World Cup
      coming to Toronto in 2026, thereby spreading the passion and fever of
      football through surrounding communities.
