      <p>
        Our primary goal is to remove financial barriers to soccer participation by providing free playing opportunities and affordable access to tournaments. 
        WHCFC strives to support Scarboroughâ€™s community by organizing soccer tournaments, family-oriented events, and educational workshops aimed at personal and professional development. 
        We also seek to build partnerships and secure sponsorships to sustain and grow our offerings, ultimately creating a lasting impact on the community through football and skill-building initiatives.
