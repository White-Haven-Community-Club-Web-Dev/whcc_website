## :bulb: Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- Angular CLI
- Git
- Figma
 
### Setting Up the Project Locally
  1. Fork the repository to your own GitHub account.
  2. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/kris20012/whcfc-web-dev.git
cd whcfc-web-dev
```

  3. Install dependencies using npm:
```
npm install

  4. Start the development server:
```
ng serve
```
The application should now be running on http://localhost:4200/.

## :inbox_tray: How to Contribute
### Reporting Issues
If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue in the GitHub repository. When reporting an issue, provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the problem.

### Creating Pull Requests
1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
```
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```
2. Make your changes in the codebase. Ensure your code follows our coding standards.
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.
4. Push your branch to your forked repository:
```
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```
5. Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the original repository.
6. Link any relevant issues in your pull request description.

### Branching Strategy
- Main Branch: The main branch contains production-ready code.
- Feature Branches: Create branches for new features or bug fixes with the naming convention feature/your-feature-name.
- Hotfix Branches: Use hotfix/your-fix-description for urgent fixes.

## :memo: Coding Standards
### HTML
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (e.g., <header>, <article>, <footer>).
- Ensure all markup is accessible (e.g., proper use of alt attributes on images).

### CSS
- Follow the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention.
- Use flexbox or CSS grid for layout.
- Prefer using CSS variables for consistent theming.

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- Follow the Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- Use const and let instead of var.
- Write functions and components that are modular and reusable.
- Avoid unnecessary dependencies.

### Angular
- Use Angular CLI for generating components, services, and other Angular modules.
- Follow the Angular Style Guide.
- Use strong typing with TypeScript.
- Structure your project according to the Angular folder-by-feature style.

## :pray: Figma Design Collaboration
- Accessing the Designs: Collaborators will be granted access to the Figma project. Make sure you're added as a collaborator.
- Using Figma: Always work on a copy of the design file. Do not modify the original unless changes are approved.
- Exporting Assets: Follow the design specifications for exporting assets (e.g., SVG, PNG). Ensure assets are optimized for web usage.

## :love_letter: Commit Messages
Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Use the following format:

```
type(scope): description

# Examples:
feat(navbar): add responsive navbar component
fix(button): resolve issue with button alignment on mobile
```

### Common Types:
- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation changes
- style: Code style changes (e.g., formatting)
- refactor: Code refactoring without changing functionality
- test: Adding or modifying tests
- chore: Maintenance or dependency updates

## :white_check_mark: Code Review Process
1. After opening a pull request, request reviews from the relevant team members or anyone.
2. Reviewers will provide feedback after testing, request changes, or approve the PR.
3. Address all comments, make any necessary changes, and push updates to your branch.
4. Once approved by one other person, the PR can be merged into the main branch.

## :nail_care: Testing
- Unit Tests: Write unit tests for your Angular components and services using Jasmine and Karma.
- End-to-End Testing: Use Protractor for end-to-end testing.
- Run Tests: Before pushing, ensure all tests pass by running:
```
ng test
ng e2e
```
